# Lab-4-Python-codes
These are some of my new Python codes. I changed some of the code so that it would function. Most of the changes I made were syntax errors, meaning that the wording and some of the phrases were incorrect. I added commas, parenthesis, and changed some of the wording to match each other. I also added new lines of code to make the program function.
